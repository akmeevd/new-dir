# This is project for training about Git
## Here, in readme file, i'll write about git from yandex practicum 

Essential moments:

1. git is vcs (version control system)

2. it helps in command developing

3. it commits changes

Basic commands:

- git add (prepaing file or files for saving)

- git commit -m "some commit" (saving of changes, -m - after this flag may write message for commit) 

Git states:

1. untracked (file is not tracked for changes)

2. staged (file is added in staging area by command ```git add```)

3. modified (file is modified and not added to staging area)

4. tracked (file is tracked for changes)
